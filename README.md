# companion-module-bitfocus-snapshot

## Getting started

Execute `yarn` command to install the dependencies.

The module can be built once with `yarn build`. This should be enough to get the module to be loadable by companion.

While developing the module, by using `yarn build:watch` the compiler will be run in watch mode to recompile the files on change.

## Changes

### v0.2.0
